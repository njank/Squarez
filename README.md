## Shapes
| Shape | Spawn Rate | Speed | Points | Effect |
|:-------------:| :-------------:|:-----| -----:|:-----|
|![red](http://njank.at/squarez/wiki/red.png)| | | | The Red Square is the player controlled Square. Move your mouse to move this square and consume other Squarez by hovering over them. |
|![blue](http://njank.at/squarez/wiki/blue.png)| 60-70%* | 1 | 10 | The most common Square. You get points by consuming it, but your Red Square is going to grow for every Blue Square consumed. |
|![black](http://njank.at/squarez/wiki/black.png)| 20% | 1.2 | 0 | The Black Square is evil. If you touch him, the is going to be over! |
|![green](http://njank.at/squarez/wiki/green.png)| 10% | 0.8 | 0 | This Square doesn't increase your points, but by consuming it, your Rer Square is going to shrink to its initial size, which makes it easier for you to outmaneuver Black Squares. |
|![orange](http://njank.at/squarez/wiki/orange.png)| 1-10%* | 1.5 | 100 | The Orange Square gives you a decent amount of points, but rotates the screen by 90 degrees. This means all Squares are flying in from a differen angle. |
|![magenta](http://njank.at/squarez/wiki/magenta.png)| 0.1% | 1.7 | 1000 | Consuming this block will handicap the player for three seconds with some weird effects and increased speed by 50%. On the other side it tremendously increases your score. |
